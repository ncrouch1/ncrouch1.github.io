Yo! I'm Noah! I'm currently an Undergraduate Electrical Engineering Student at the University of Washington. I'm about to graduate and am currently applying for PhD programs in Computer Science across the country. During my time here I performed research at the [UbiComp Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/) directed by [Doctor Shwetak Patel](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/), led by PhD candidate [Jerry Cao](https://jerrycao22.github.io/). I'm interested in Human-Computer Interaction as well as Human-Computer Integration related to accessibilty and depth of experience. In my PhD I plan to address accessibilty of devices by challenging the ways we currenly interact with them, creating means to connect oneself deeper to their device and other humans!
