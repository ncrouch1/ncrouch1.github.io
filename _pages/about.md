Hi! I'm Noah! I recently received my Bachelors of Science in Electrical *And Computer* Enginering with an Embedded Systems Concentration from the University of Washington. I'm currently looking for full time employement and/or a masters degree program! During my time here I performed research at the [UbiComp Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/) directed by [Dr. Shwetak Patel](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/), led by PhD student [Jerry Cao](https://jerrycao22.github.io/). I'm interested in Human-Computer Interaction as well as Human-Computer Integration related to accessibilty and depth of experience. In my career I plan to address accessibilty of devices by challenging the ways we currenly interact with them, creating means to connect oneself deeper to their devices and other humans!

* at the time I graduated from the University of Washington I was unable to switch to the new Electrical and Computer Engineering major from the established Electrical Engineering major. Although my resume and diploma do not contain *And Computer* my skillset does contain the same skills you'd find with a typical Electrical And Computer Engineering Bachelors candidate.
