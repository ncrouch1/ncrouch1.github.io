Today I officially launched my website! If you're here, welcome to my page! I'm glad to have you!

About this site
======
This site is primarily here to advertise myself as a potential employee, and as a potential graduate student. This site contains all the needed information a recruiter or a admissions board may need to determine if they want to accept me. The top bar contains navigation links. The first is my Curriculum Vitae! This is primarily for admissions board members or academia fellows, but if you're a recruiter and need more information on my background, please take a look! The second link is my Resume! This is pretty much a concise version of my CV. Next, we have my portfolio page! There you can find information about the projects I take pride in. Lastly, we have Blog Posts! This is where you are currently! And thats pretty much it! Thanks for checking out my site!

Note: If I am accepted to a PhD program in the future more navigation links will be provided and more information will be given to indicate the purpose of those links.

Best,
Noah
