Introducing my latest project, Quizzle. A platform similar to Quizlet in structure using flash card decks to aid users in memorizing key terms but with games!

Motivation
=====
One day while playing Wordle I had an idea. Why does Quizlet not include games? Gamification has been a research topic interest of mine for a while now. So when I had that thought I decided, if they're not going to make it, I'll make it.
